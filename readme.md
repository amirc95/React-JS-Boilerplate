# React JS App Boilerplate (WIP)

This project contains a React.js setup using:

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- TypeScript coming soon

The advantage here compared to a [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) is the full access of configuration files making it possible to refine your setup for your current project.
